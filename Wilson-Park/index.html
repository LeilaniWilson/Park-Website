    <p>Yellowstone National Park has been a major tourist attraction and home to many different species of wildlife since 1997. We are located in the northwest corner of Wyoming, and we also include small areas of Montana and Idaho as well.</p>

    <p>Yellowstone is also the site of America's greatest concentration of geysers and hot springs. They form a visible and amazing link with the primeval forces of the Earth's creation. Yellowstone is the oldest national park in the whole country. Yellowstone began when some of the territory's first explorers created a campaign to preserve the beauty of the land for many generations from that point in time. Two million acres of high mountain - ringed plateau has been set aside for permanant protection as a natural preserve. It is known as America's finest and most diverse vacationland.    </p>
